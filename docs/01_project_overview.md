# Project Overview

**Goal:** Predict and analyse Black Harrier movement and turbine collision risk to inform wind farm siting and operations.

- Endangered species (~1000 adults) with seasonal breeding/migration.
- ABM with behaviour states, environmental drivers (DEM, habitat, wind), and turbine interactions.
- Outputs: tracks, time-in-BSA, heatmaps, scenario comparisons.
